1. Dependencies
########################################

This program works with Python 2.7 and uses NLTK for tokenization and
pos tagging and context2vec as dependencies


2. How to use
########################################

You can either run the program on all the corpus or in interactive
mode

  2.1 Interactive mode
  ----------------------------------------

  In interactive mode, you can type text, which is processed and
  printed as output. You can use this program in interactive mode by
  running

    python interactive.py <context2vec_param>

  where context2vec_param is the path to the .param file of a pretrained
  contex2vec model. It has been tested on ukwac, you can download it here

    http://irsrv2.cs.biu.ac.il/downloads/context2vec/context2vec.ukwac.model.package.tar.gz

  example : python interactive.py path/to/context2vec.ukwac.model.params

  2.2 Running on all the corpus
  ----------------------------------------

  You can also run the program on a whole corpus file by running

    python process_corpus.py <contex2vec_param> <corpus> [N]

  context2vec_param is the path to the .param file of a pretrained
  contex2vec model as before.

  corpus is the path of the corpus file

  N is the number of line to process (it has been set to reduce the time), it
  defaults to 1000 but can be set to -1 if you want to process the whole corpus
  (might take long)

  example: python process_corpus.py path/to/context2vec.ukwac.model.params \
           path/to/CorpusBataclan_en.1M.raw.txt
